# Hack Assembler

[Failure]

This here is more of an ass-embler as it doesn't work all the time.

It works great for all the test files that [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) provides except for the `Pong.asm` file.

I have no idea where to even start the degubbing process. It works great for all the other files so I have no idea what is the problem while assembling this one file.\
And my horrendous coding skills aren't helping even a tiny bit.\
For this specific file among those that they give, for testing your assembler, it generates extra lines of code for some reason.

I do not have much experience with rust, this is only my second time creating an *"actual program"* with the first one being the [password generator](https://github.com/renamice/Password-Generator).

However, this has been a good learning experience in regards to both my rust skills and knowledge about the fundamentals of computer.
